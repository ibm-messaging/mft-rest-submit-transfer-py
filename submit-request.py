# This file contains the source code for submitting a transfer request
# to a IBM MQ Managed File Transfer agent using REST APIs and then query
# the status of transfer.
#
# The program does the following:
# 1) Builds a JSON object containing the transfer request.
# 2) Builds a HTTP POST request and then submits it to IBM MQ Web Server.
# 3) Builds a HTTP GET request with URL returned in step #2 above to query
#    the status of a transfer. If transfer status is not yet available, the
#    program waits for 5 seconds and resubmits the HTTP GET request again to
#    query the transfer status.
#
# This program assumes the following:
# 1) MFT network has been setup with at least two agents.
# 2) Basic authentication for REST APIs has been configured.
# 3) MQ Web Server has been configured and started.
